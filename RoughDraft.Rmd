Rough Draft




# Introduction

+ Why we took on the project
+ What we're trying to solve 



## EDA 





### Clustering



# Analyses

## Splitting into training/testing


## Model 1 - Logistic / QDA

+ Mention how the model works, why we picked the model

+ Why we're doing certain steps (Cross validation)

+ Considerations while fitting (conditions are met)

+ Test/train results, confusion matrix + accuracy + specificity/sensitivity


+ Keep in mind model specific subjects (pruning)


## Model 2 - Tree-based




## Model 3 - SVM




## Comparing them all together

+ Full table of the results

-> Just testing accuracy/spec/sens 


# Conclusion
